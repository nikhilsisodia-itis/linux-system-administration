# Alias

## What is Alias?

- An alias is a shortcut or a custom command that represents a longer command or a series of commands in the shell.
- It allows users to create a more convenient way to execute frequently used commands.
- Aliases can be defined in the shell configuration files (like `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`) to make them persistent across sessions.
- They can also be created temporarily in the current shell session.
- Aliases can include options and arguments, making complex commands easier to remember and use.

## Creating Aliases

- To create an alias, use the `alias` command followed by the name of the alias and the command it represents.
- Example: `alias ll='ls -la'` creates an alias `ll` that runs `ls -la`.
- To make an alias permanent, add the alias command to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`).
- After adding an alias to the configuration file, you need to source the file or restart the terminal for the changes to take effect.
- Example: `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile`.
- To view all currently defined aliases, simply type `alias` in the terminal.
- To remove an alias, use the `unalias` command followed by the name of the alias.
- Example: `unalias ll` removes the alias `ll`.
