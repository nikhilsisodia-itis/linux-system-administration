# Introduction to Linux Commands

## What are Linux Commands?

- Linux commands are the building blocks for interacting with the shell and performing various tasks.
- Commands are typically entered in the terminal and can be combined with options and arguments to modify their behavior.
- Use the `--help` option with any command to display its help information and usage instructions.
  - Example: `ls --help`
- The `man` command is used to display the manual pages for other commands, providing detailed information about their usage and options.
  - Example: `man ls`

## Parts of a Command

- The command name is the name of the program or utility that you want to run.
- Options (or flags) are optional parameters that modify the behavior of the command. They usually start with a hyphen (-) or double hyphen (--).
- Arguments are the input or target for the command, such as file names or directories.
  - Example: In the command `ls -l /home/user`, `ls` is the command name, `-l` is an option, and `/home/user` is an argument.
- Commands can be combined using pipes (`|`) to pass the output of one command as input to another command.
